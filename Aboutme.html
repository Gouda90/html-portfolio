    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m Ahmed, an architect turned web developer, blending design thinking with technology to build functional and visually engaging digital experiences. My journey started in architecture, where I honed my skills in problem-solving, structural planning, and aesthetics. Now, I bring that same precision and creativity to the world of web development.

        With a deep appreciation for design and user experience, I specialize in crafting clean, efficient, and intuitive websites. My background in architecture gives me a unique perspective on structure, logic, and functionality—whether in buildings or in code.
        
        Excited to bridge the gap between design and development, I’m constantly learning, building, and pushing boundaries. Let’s create something amazing together!</p>
